        <p>Sometimes we feel like no one really cares.

            I know because this negative thought has entered my mind during difficult emotional times.
            
            And I know Im not the only one.
            
            Heres the truth, though, we are loved.
            
            Whether its our puppy running up to us when we return home, a friend buying us coffee, or a simple Happy Birthday text, we receive different forms of love every day.Being creative isnt reserved for the people who can sew, paint and do anything DIY.

            You are also creative if you find a new way to solve a problem!
            
            Maybe thats creating a way to meal prep for the week, as I have. Or perhaps you always know what to say to make people feel good, especially when they need hope during tough times. Breathing is a miracle we don’t stop to think about very much. We just do it. It keeps us alive. In the same amazing way God has given us as Christians a way to “breathe spiritually” for our spiritual well-being. Spiritual breathing, like physical breathing, is a process of exhaling the impure and inhaling the pure. It can become a way of life.

            But the average Christian does not understand this concept and as a result lives on a spiritual roller coaster, controlling his or her own,  life resulting in frustration. On our own we may at times have a fresh start in life only to lose it again – negative thoughts, angry words, slammed doors…… How could this change?
            
            It could change by learning and applying the concept of spiritual breathing, which is like physical breathing in that:
            
            You “exhale” by confessing your sins as soon as you become aware of it, and claim God’s forgiveness…. And then……
            You “inhale” by asking the Holy Spirit to once again control and empower you to help you from returning to that sin.
            Usually we don’t give much thought to our physical breathing. But spiritual breathing is something that requires conscious action – a readiness to “exhale”, or confess our sin, and to “inhale”, or trust God to fill us with his Holy Spirit.
